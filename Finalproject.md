# Interior Secretary Issues Recommendation to Trump on National Monuments, but Withholds Details

U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is asking President Trump to decrease the size of a “handful” of national monuments, according to an exclusive interview Thursday with The Associated Press. But recommends that none of the 27 national monuments under review should be eliminated entirely.

Zinke, however, did not identify which sites or how many would have new boundaries. He sent a draft report to President Trump on his findings and recommendations on national monuments, without providing details. Zinke said in a statement that the national monuments will maintain federal property, protected by federal environmental regulations.

“It provides a much needed change for the local communities who [sic] border and rely on these lands for hunting and fishing, economic development, traditional uses and recreation,” said Zinke in the Interior statement. 

It is unknown whether President Trump will accept Zinke’s recommendations. A White House official told reporters Thursday that President Trump has received Zinke’s report and is currently reviewing the recommendations.

According to U.S. Department of the Interior, Zinke’s recommendations followed a 120-day review and included more than 60 meetings with advocates and opponents of monuments designations.

"No President should use the authority under the Antiquities Act to restrict public access, prevent hunting and fishing, burden private land, or eliminate traditional land uses, unless such action is needed to protect the object," said Zinke.

The statement was criticized by environmentalists, who strongly opposed any potential decrease in the size of national monuments. 

“We and millions of other Americans stand by the belief that those lands should be preserved and handed down to future generations,” said Jamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society in a statement. “We urge President Trump to ignore these illegal and dangerous recommendations and instead act to preserve these beloved places.”

In April, Trump ordered federal officials to review two decades of national monument designations, and charged that former President Barack Obama’s designation of monuments during his eight-year term had been “egregious abuse of federal power.” Trump said reducing the number of sites was intended to open up more federal land to drilling, mining and other development.

Last Wednesday, Sand to Snow National Monument in the southern California desert is safe from the Trump administration’s review list. 

Sand to Snow, a 154,000 acres monument that includes 30 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, was created last year by President Obama. It is the first California monument that Zinke promised to release from a list of sites that could be marked for elimination. 

“The land of Sand to Snow National Monument is some of the most diverse terrain in the West, and the monument is home to incredible geographic, biologic, and archaeological history of our nation,” said Zinke in a news release.

Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, California Assembly member, whose district includes the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument, led the charge in the California State Legislature to pass successfully a bi-partisan resolution in favor of protecting several monuments under review.  

“It’s really important to my region,” said Aguiar-Curry at a Wilderness Society conference. “I personally worked very hard to get this monument passed, starting at the grassroots level, working with stakeholders, farmers she said. “I worked with cattle ranchers, I worked with horseback associations, off road vehicle associations, the Wilderness Society, with the Sierra Clubs – we’ve worked with everyone to make sure we had ample public outreach that people understood what the importance was to save this big beautiful area.”

Participants in a Wilderness Society conference on last Wednesday said that concerns about monuments extend beyond California. 

Blake Spaulding, a restaurant owner in the Boulder Mountain area of Utah, expressed concern about the impact a closure would have on local businesses. She said neighboring Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument is vital to the local economy and her thriving restaurant. Without it, her 50-employee business might not survive.

“Without the monument, our business wouldn’t exist,” Spaulding said. “Last year, our county did $78 million with the tourism-based business, much of them due directly to the monument.”  

During the department’s public review process since Trump’s April announcement, 2.7 million people submitted comments opposing changes to the monuments on the Department of the Interior website, according to the Wilderness Society.


Prior to the announced Thursday, six national monuments had already been removed from potential elimination or boundary decrease. Those monuments are Craters of the Moon in Idaho; Hanford Reach in Washington State; Upper Missouri River Breaks in Montana; Grand Canyon-Parashant in Arizona; Canyons of the Ancients in Colorado; and Sand to Snow in California.

Twenty-one other sites are still under review. There was no information about when the status of these would be determined and announced.

“If Secretary Zinke expects Americans to be thankful because he wants to merely erase large chunks of national monuments instead of eliminating them entirely, he is badly mistaken,” said Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities in a statement.

# Process:

Trump administration is planning to eliminate national monuments. I am really interested in environmental issue, so when the news came out last Wednesday said Sand to Snow National Monument in the southern California desert is safe from the Trump administration’s review list, I decided to do this story. 

There are so many data sets around this issue, I find the list of 27 monuments which are under the review list, so I made a graph about which states are these monuments in, and how many monuments in each states. So after I made this graph, I can clearly figure it out that California is the state that has most monuments under reviewed. After Sand to Snow out of this list, they still have five monuments facing size decreased. 

So after analysis these data, it is easy for me to know California will keep focusing on this issue, when I cover this story I may interview California people and ask their opinion. People are risk in losing their land. All in all, data can tell a story and can help me keep finding new source. I enjoy doing this final project, and thank you for teaching us this quarter, I learned a lot.
