Consumer Price Indexes (CPI) are data on changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a representative basket of goods and services.
The data is provided by the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistic, and is the inflation calculator of economy. Here I compare the CPI between 2011 and 2016, we do see some changes in five years.
