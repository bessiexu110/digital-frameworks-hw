# Darren Soto
Elected in 2016, Darren Soto represents Central Florida in Congress. The 9th District includes all of Osceola and parts of Orange and Polk Counties, and is home to many of the people who make Orlando’s theme parks world-renowned, who grow more citrus and raise more cattle than anywhere else in the State, and who explore the farthest reaches of the galaxy from the Kennedy Space Center. 

Before Soto being elected to Congress, he served for four years in the Florida Senate and five in the Florida House of Representatives. As the first Floridian of Puerto Rican descent to serve in Congress, Soto is proud to represent all the diverse people of the 9th District. He fought to create high paying jobs, increase access to higher education, and ensure clean water, land, and air for his constituents. Soto passed landmark legislation protecting families of fallen firefighters, giving victims of sexual assault more time to report their attackers, and allowing Dreamers to be admitted to the Florida Bar. He also secured $25 million to build a state of the art college campus in the District, helped provide $10 million to save Florida’s springs, and brought in $15 million for a high-tech sensors manufacturing facility.                                       

When the Trump Administration set out the new budget plan in March, Soto spoke out and against these cruel cuts to healthcare, farm aid, cancer and other science research, and small businesses. Also Soto was speaking out for “The Direct Connect to Success Act”, a bill to help striving students who graduate from a two-year community college take the next step in their education. It guarantees graduates with at least a 2.0 GPA to admission into a participating four-year state university. Recently Soto is not afraid to speak plainly about Trump care, he says Trump is acting to sabotage healthcare for millions of Americans.
